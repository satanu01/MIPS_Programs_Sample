Questions

Q1. Write a MIPS program to check whether the data stored in consecutive memory locations is a palindrome number or not. To know the end of the number, a zero is appended at the end of the memory location, so this should be neglected.

Input/output sample: 
series1: word 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 0 → “Not Palindrome”
series2 : word 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 0 → “Palindrome”

Q2. Write a MIPS program to print the Fibonacci series up to N numbers where the first term starts with the k-th number (k is in {1,2,3,….}). 
Input: K=3, N=5
Output: 3 3 6 9 15

Q3. Write a MIPS program to check whether a number is an Armstrong number or not.

Q4. Write a MIPS program to find out all the factors of a given number. 

Q5. Write a MIPS program to check whether a number is even or odd.
